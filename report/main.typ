  //   'Ilm (Urdu: #text(lang: "ur", font: ("Noto Nastaliq Urdu", "Noto Naskh Arabic"), size: 0.8em)[عِلْم]) is the Urdu term for knowledge. In its general usage, 'ilm may refer to knowledge of any specific thing or any form of "learning". Subsequently, the term came to be used to refer to various categories of "sciences", especially when used in its plural form ('ulum).

= Introduction

From an evolutionary standpoint, humans are extremely strange creatures.

Despite only accounting for \~2% of our body mass, a human brain consumes \~20%
of our energy. We are bipedal, and while it freed our hands for other uses made us
worse runners and more vulnerable to back problems. The complexity of our brains
meant we have extremely long developmental periods, where we needed to depend on
adults to live.

There are hundreds of species faster, nimbler, bigger, and certainly deadlier than us.
Most enjoy from extreme biological adaptations to their environment, giving them
exceptional stealth and speed. Yet, we are the dominating species. We established
presence in almost every corner of the world. It took eons for humanity to learn agriculture— but only
milennia later we sent people to the moon and back.

The greatest distinguishing factor might not be the size of our brains nor the dexterity
of our hands, but the way we think. We spend so much time growing up, being
defenseless, because it's an advantage to learn from passed down knowledge instead of having it
encoded in our DNA. It made us versatile enough to learn new things quickly, internalize them
as if they were always part of us, and pass them down to the next generation.

Our versatility left us room for expression, and creativity. Even with our hands alone we are able to transmit
endless amounts of knowledge. Place something into those hands, and knowledge is no longer
a limit. We were able to transcend our needs for survival. We chose to explore our world,
understand its nature, and create not for our survival, but for ourselves.

I have always been fascinated with instruments and music. I love the way human beings
can learn to play an instrument as a part of their own body. I love even more the fact
that our ears have apparently been designed with an attunement to music, to rhythms and harmony.
And what I love most is that music is a language: it transmits information, it has
certain rules, and it is unique to every culture, ethnicity, country or group of people.

Most people love music. But most people don't play it. I feel most people would like
to play music. Of course, learning an instrument, or even learning to 'speak' the language of
music takes both time and patience, which most people don't have enough of. Some people don't
even try. I want to change that. And while I most definitely can't, not with a hasty,
bodged prototype I put together in less than a week, the intention is there. And who's
to say it wouldn't be interesting to see?

= Background

Of course, music is not the only type of expression. Visual art has been present
as long, if not longer. Similarly, it has been a space to explore diferent mediums, both
to put the art in (canvas, paper, cave walls), what the art is made of (oil-based paints with
dyes, objects, the shadows those objects cast), and the tools to make it (hands, fingers, brushes,
industrial machinery, and computers). It only took a few years since computers became generally available
to the general public in the 1960's for computer-based generative art to be created.
Several artists are considered the pioneers of this field, many of which served as inspiration
for my portfolio of works for this course.

== Vera Molnár

Vera Molnár was born in Hungaria in 1924. After studying aesthetics and art
history in the Hungarian University of Fine Arts, she moved to Paris. In 1960, she
began making drawings following specific algorithms, a method she called "machine imaginaire",
or "imaginary machine", referring to the fact she had not yet been able to
use an actual computer for the task.

In 1968, she finally got her chance after asking the head of computing at Paris University if she
could use their computers to make art. Their reaction was one of confusion, Molnár recalls, and was later
told by them that the reason she was granted her request was because of a famous quote:

#set quote(block: true)
#quote(attribution: [Voltaire])[
  I completely disagree with everything that you are saying but will defend until my death your right to do or say or write what
you have in mind.

Her works mainly involve the composition of simple shapes#sym.dash.em lines, squares, triangles.
By using simple rules, influenced by random values, the end result becomes more than just
the sum of its parts. She explores the blurry line between order and chaos.
